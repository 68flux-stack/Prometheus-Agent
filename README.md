Prometheus is an open-source coding and research agent for general and long-running work. It is designed around two core abstractions:

- The **[Recursive Language Model (RLM)](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/rlm)** treats context as variables (*prompt-as-a-variable*) and tools like recursive subagents as function calls (*programmatic tool /sub-agent calling*) inside a persistent REPL.
- The **[Continual Harness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.09998)** stores supplemental prompts, memories, skill descriptions, and reusable subagent specifications as durable state that Prometheus can refine through small, evidence-backed updates, local to the session by default.

Prometheus combines a persistent Python control environment with durable harness state, so useful working context and reusable operating patterns can outlive a single chat window.

- **Everything is programmatic:** persistent IPython is the built-in model tool; file operations, shell commands, tool use, subagents, and context management happen through code.
- **Subagents are built in:** `rlm(...)` spawns real child agents for parallel or background work and returns their results programmatically.
- **The harness can improve:** `/refine` reviews the current trajectory and can apply small, evidence-backed updates to supplemental harness state. It never rewrites the immutable base system prompt, and recorded snapshots support rollback.
- **Skills are executable:** skills are importable Python packages, and the built-in skill creator can turn recurring workflows into project or personal skills.
- **Sessions run in the background:** daemon-backed agents keep running when the terminal disconnects and can be reattached later.
- **Agents communicate directly:** running agents can exchange messages and orchestrate one another without routing everything through the user.
- **Long tasks keep moving:** automatic compaction, persistent goals, heartbeats, schedules, autonomous mode, and retained subagents preserve progress across turns and terminal sessions.

## Getting Started

Install the latest stable release on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://app.primeintellect.ai/prometheus/install.sh | sh
```

The installer downloads a versioned release, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, installs the `prometheus` command, and can prepare the IPython runtime used by the agent.

Start Prometheus from the repository or directory you want it to work in:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
prometheus
```

## Desktop app

The repository also includes an Electron desktop client backed by the same RPC engine as the CLI. It keeps the full Prometheus runtime (tools, sessions, models, subagents, schedules, and continual harness) in a separate process while providing a native chat workspace.

From the repository root, install dependencies and build the agent packages once:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then start the desktop client:

```bash
npm run desktop:dev
```

Choose a workspace from the left sidebar to point the agent at another project. The desktop client supports streaming prompts, aborting work, model and thinking-level selection, new sessions, session statistics, and HTML export. API credentials are read from the same environment variables and auth storage used by the CLI.

On first launch, run `/login` to choose a subscription or API-key provider. Prometheus works in the current directory and can run commands and modify files there. Use a disposable clone, clean worktree, or another checkpoint you can inspect and restore.

> [!WARNING]
> Prometheus executes model-generated Python and project commands with your user permissions. Its worker and kernel processes improve lifecycle isolation and recovery; they are **not** a security sandbox. Review changes and use trusted repositories, instructions, skills, and extensions only. Run untrusted code or instructions in an external sandbox or restricted environment.

Useful commands:

```bash
prometheus agents                   # Browse running, idle, and saved sessions
prometheus attach <agent>           # Reattach to a running session
prometheus --resume <path|id>       # Resume a saved session
prometheus status                   # Inspect background service state
prometheus doctor [--fix]           # Inspect or repair background services
prometheus update [--force]         # Update Prometheus
prometheus shutdown [--force]       # Stop every agent, worker, and background service
```

## Built for Long-Running Work
Prometheus is built for long-running work, especially for evaluations in research. These features are available in the TUI, and when run autonomously.

- **Continual Harness:** `/refine` can persist focused, reviewable lessons as supplemental prompts, memories, reusable skill descriptions, or subagent specifications, with recorded refinement history. It does not replace packaging and reviewing new executable skills.
- **Direct agent-to-agent communication:** running agents and retained subagents can discover one another, exchange messages, and steer active work.
- **Daemon-backed continuity:** active sessions, IPython state, schedules, and subagents keep running when the terminal detaches and can be reattached later.
- **Heartbeats and schedules:** `/heartbeat`, `rlm_heartbeat`, and `prometheus schedule` can re-enter a session periodically or at a specific time.
- **Persistent goals:** `/goal` keeps an objective and its progress active across turns until it is completed, paused, or cleared.
- **Bounded autonomous mode:** `/autonomous` continues within configured turn, token, and time budgets and can run user-defined quality gates. A passed gate checks only what that gate verifies; reaching a limit does not imply task success.
